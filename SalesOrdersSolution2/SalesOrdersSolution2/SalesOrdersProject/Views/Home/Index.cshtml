            This is a classic Black Mountain trail and was featured in Freehub Magazine's
            Pisgah Photo Book: Issue 6. The climb to the top ends with a beautiful vista of
            Twin Lakes and the surrounding area. Out of the parking lot, take your first left.
            Tree is elevated, so not rideable for most. While it has no real technical features
            to speak of since being redesigned, it is a lot of fun to ride this glassy smooth and
            generally well-bermed trail.

            Watch that you don't overshoot the switchback to stay on the black diamond
            descent - the blue route is completely overgrown. This created a reroute of the single
            track. The decent to the upper Chimney Beach parking area is an amazing finish to
            what was likely a great ride with amazing views. All hits are roll-able and built for
            progressing your jumping skillz. Freeze-thaw cycle isn't awful, but does make this trail
            rather slick.

            If you continue, the trail ends at one of the lakes and continues lakeside until reaching
            the point where you began the trail The lake-side bit is fairly technical and very fun.
            Rowdy little downhill/freeride track. The trails are well drained and suitable for riding
            when wet. Third Divide makes up part of the classic Downieville downhill route. There
            are actually three trails which make up the loop: Horse Creek-Cattle Creek-Lower Twin
            Lake.
